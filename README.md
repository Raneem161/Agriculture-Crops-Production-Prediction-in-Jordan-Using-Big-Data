# Agriculture-Crops-Production-Prediction-in-Jordan-Using-Big-Data

## Overview
This project uses big data to analyze the correlation between weather conditions in two regions of Jordan (Irbid and Ghor al Safi) and the agricultural production of tomatoes, eggplants, and broad beans. The project involved collecting, exploring, manipulating, and visualizing weather data from ArabiaWeather and production data from the Jordanian Department of Statistics. After extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering to identify factors like "bad temperature/humidity counts" and season, relationships were modelled using linear regression and the results were verified with visualizations and performance measures. Ultimately, the analysis supports data-driven decision-making by providing predictions and recommendations for future agricultural commitments based on weather insights.
